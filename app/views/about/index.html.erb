KidBank was founded on Feb 1, 2017 for several reasons:
<br/>
<br/>
<ol>
  <li>for <a href="https://higher.team">higher.team</a> students to really dig their teeth into a real startup startup</li>
  <li>To give parents a better way to educatate their kids about how to save, avoid debt and be good bank customers. Or bad bank customers depending how you think about it, if they learn to avoid fees, pay bills on time they will make less money for the bank.</li>
</ol>
